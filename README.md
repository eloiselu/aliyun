# Alibaba Cloud Homepage

When I purchased their services, I was really impressed by the Alibaba Cloud homepage. It had a stunning design with vibrant effects, so I decided to give it a try and recreate the page.

- The data displayed on the page is rendered using JSON data.
- HTML5 is used to create semantic markup for the page.
- The banner section features a slideshow implemented with CSS3 to create a visually appealing effect. The images in the banner also respond to mouse movement, creating a sense of depth and parallax.
- The "Services" section in the middle of the page functions like an accordion, with four panels. When you hover over a panel, it enlarges, allowing you to view detailed information for that section.
- The map section features expanding circles around location markers, creating a zooming effect.
